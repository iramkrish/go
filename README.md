# 🛠️ Golang Learning Path for a Frontend Engineer

## 🎯 Goal

To become proficient in backend development using **Go (Golang)**, with a focus on building performant, production-ready APIs and services that complement frontend applications.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Go Fundamentals

### 🎯 Objective

Grasp Go’s core syntax and foundational building blocks.

### 🔑 Topics

* Variables, constants, data types
* Control flow: `if`, `switch`, loops
* Arrays, slices, maps
* Functions (named, anonymous, variadic)
* Structs and interfaces
* Pointers and memory management
* Error handling (`if err != nil`)
* Packages and modular code

### 📚 Resources

* [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/)
* [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/)

### 🔧 Tooling

* `go fmt`, `go run`, `go build`, `go mod`

### ⏱️ Time Estimate

**3–5 days**

---

## ✅ Phase 2: Build a Simple REST API

### 🎯 Objective

Understand how to build and serve HTTP APIs using Go's standard library.

### 🔑 Concepts

* `net/http` package
* Routing via `http.HandleFunc`
* JSON encoding/decoding with `encoding/json`
* Structs for requests and responses
* Handling query and path parameters
* Setting custom HTTP status codes

### 🛠️ Mini Project: **Book Store API**

* `GET /books` – list all books
* `GET /book/:id` – fetch a single book
* `POST /book` – create a book

### ⏱️ Time Estimate

**5–7 days**

---

## ✅ Phase 3: Web Framework – Gin

### 🎯 Objective

Use **Gin**, a fast and minimalist web framework, to build scalable APIs.

### 🔑 Topics

* Routing with Gin
* Middleware (logging, authentication, etc.)
* Route grouping
* Request context and lifecycle
* Path/query param parsing
* Request validation

### 💡 Framework

* [Gin Web Framework](https://gin-gonic.com/)

### ⏱️ Time Estimate

**4–5 days**

---

## ✅ Phase 4: Database Integration

### 🎯 Objective

Integrate SQL databases and perform persistent operations.

### 🧰 Tools

* **PostgreSQL** (preferred) or **SQLite**
* ORM/DB tools: `gorm` or `sqlx`
* Migrations: `golang-migrate`

### 🔑 Concepts

* DB connection management
* CRUD operations
* SQL transactions
* Prepared statements
* Migrations

### 🛠️ Project Update:

Extend **Book Store API** to support full database functionality.

### ⏱️ Time Estimate

**5–7 days**

---

## ✅ Phase 5: Performance & Concurrency

### 🎯 Objective

Use Go’s concurrency model to write scalable and performant services.

### 🔑 Topics

* Goroutines
* Channels
* Worker pools and task queues
* Rate limiting (basic or with Redis)
* Caching (Redis, groupcache)
* Profiling and performance analysis with `pprof`

### 💡 Project Ideas

* File processor with worker pool
* Rate-limited API gateway

### ⏱️ Time Estimate

**5–7 days**

---

## ✅ Phase 6: Deployment & Packaging

### 🎯 Objective

Learn to build, containerize, and deploy Go applications.

### 🔑 Topics

* Building Go binaries
* Dockerizing Go applications
* Environment variable management
* `.env` support using `godotenv`
* Static vs dynamic builds

### 🧰 Tools

* `go build`, `go mod`
* Docker
* `air` (live reloading)
* `cobra` (CLI creation)

### ⏱️ Time Estimate

**3–4 days**

---

## ✅ Bonus: Testing in Go

### 🎯 Objective

Write reliable and maintainable Go tests.

### 🔑 Topics

* `testing` package
* Table-driven tests
* Mocks and dependency injection
* Using `httptest` for API testing

### ⏱️ Time Estimate

**2–3 days**

---

## 🧱 Final Project Ideas

Pick one or more to solidify everything you've learned:

* 🔗 **URL Shortener** (Go + Redis)
* 📊 **Analytics Tracker** – backend for usage metrics
* 🧪 **Feature Flag Service**
* 🔁 **Custom API Gateway** – with rate limiting and caching
* 🧹 **Background Job Processor** – using goroutines and channels
